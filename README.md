# Weather-_prediction
# Short Description:
This project focuses on predicting future weather conditions using past weather data. The notebook imports and preprocesses a weather dataset, handles missing values, and encodes categorical features using one-hot encoding. A Linear Regression model is then trained to predict the average temperature (BASEL_temp_mean) based on other weather parameters. The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R² Score, and the results are visualized through a scatter plot comparing actual and predicted values.
